# Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-style portfolio 👩🏽‍💻  
It showcases my journey as a backend developer through real coding challenges, multilingual support, and a unique tech stack visualization.

## Highlights

- ⌨️ **Interactive Terminal** — Real commands with history and state
- 🧩 **Adventure Mode** — Challenges based on bugs I actually solved
- 🌍 **Multilingual** — English, Spanish, and French with persistence
- 🧠 **Recruiter Mode** — Clean view with only the essential info
- 🛠 **Tech Stack Map** — Interactive display of my tools and skills

## Built With...

### Frontend

- **Next.js 13+** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- Responsive design with custom CSS
- Context API for state management

### Backend

- **Ruby on Rails 7+** + **PostgreSQL**
- RESTful API with multilingual support using JSONB
- Modular concerns for clean architecture
